            <br><br>
            <p>
                The only law school in the province of Benguet, and one of the oldest law schools in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), the CCDC College of Law is located here in Buyagan, Poblacion, La Trinidad, Benguet, just within the vicinity of the so-called strawberry fields of the La Trinidad valley.
            </p><br>
            <p>CCDC President James M. Malaya (whose undiminished energy is never lost all these years) and among faculty members of the CCDC Graduate School, the idea of putting up a CCDC College of Law was introduced by the late Atty. Romeo G. Gumpic (may he rest in peace!). At that time, Dean Gumpic, or Sir Romy as he is most fondly called was not yet a lawyer; he was then the Vice President for Finance and Dean of the College of Accountancy, he being a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The College of Law envisions to prepare lawyers who are committed to the Constitution, a representative government, and a democratic way of life under a Rule of Law that is tempered with social justice.            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>In pursuance of its vision, the College of Law shall strive to attain the following goals to serve as the pillars of its legal education program:</p>
<h2>Strategies:</h2>
            <p>In order to attain its goals, the College of Law will adopt the following strategies:</p><br>
            <p>1. Inculcate upon the faculty members the imperious need of balancing academic freedom with duty vis-Ã -vis the noble creeds of education, and lead a professional life edifying the ethical code that he too practices what he preaches;</p><br>
            <p>2. Motivate the students to equip themselves with competent knowledge of law and jurisprudence, and develop an analytical, objective, and critical mind, strong moral and upright character, and sufficient communication skills in English to enable them to satisfy the necessary standards of the legal profession;;</p><br>
            <p>3. expose the students, as part of the law curriculum, to courtroom and law-office conditions that will afford them the opportunities to experience, actually and vicariously, the realities of legal practice; and<p><br>
            <p>provide the students with incentives for the development of their leadership skills and social consciousness necessary for a fuller appreciation of, and involvement in, the dynamics of social justice that animate the Rule of Law.</p><br>
